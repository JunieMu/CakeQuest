PROJECT TITLE: CakeQuest
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: This game was created for my mid-term project for CS III.
VERSION or DATE: 2023
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: This game was created using blueJ. Open the package.bluej file and run the Project1Runner class and the game should load!
AUTHORS: Joyce Ma and Misha Anand
USER INSTRUCTIONS: You are playing the game as a cat collecting a number of ingredients to create the perfect cake! In each of the 3 levels, you can use arrow keys to jump and avoid obstacles. If you hit an obstacle, you will lose a heart, and if you lose all hearts, it is game over. Good luck!
